Set Theory A set is an unordered collection of unique items. For example, $A = \\{ 8, 1, 2 \\}$ is a set with items (elements) $8$, $1$, and $2$.\nSets are unordered, so $\\{8, 1, 2 \\} = \\{2, 8, 1\\}$. Sets contain unique elemnts, so $\\{8, 1, 2, 1\\}$ is NOT a set. Sets are a collection of any type of item, so $\\{A, B, C\\}$, $\\{\\text{car, cow, walnut}\\}$, and $\\{$‚ù§Ô∏è, üë®‚Äçüè´, ‚è≥$\\}$ are all sets. 1.1 Definitions $A$ is a subset of $B$ (notated $A \\subset B$ or $A \\subseteq B$) if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.\nThe empty set (notated $\\emptyset$) is the set with no elements, $\\{\\}$.\nThe union (notated $A \\cup B$) is the set of all elements that are in $A$ or $B$ (or both).\nThe intersection (notated $A \\cap B$) is the set of all elements that are in both $A$ and $B$.\n$A$ and $B$ are disjoint if $A$ and $B$ share no elements (notated $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$)\nA collection of sets $A_1, \\ldots, A_n$ are disjoint if no pair of sets shares any elements ($A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset$ for all $i, j$) A collection of sets $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n$ are a parition of $B$ if\n$B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n$ are disjoint, and $B_1 \\cup B_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup B_n = B$. Intuitively, $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n$ are (non-overlapping) puzzle pieces that form the the puzzle, $B$, when put together.\nThe complement of a set $A$ (notated $A^c$) is the set of all elements not in $A$\nComplements have to be taken relative to some superset $S$ (notated $A \\subset S$). We think of this set as the ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù that $A$ lives in, and is usually implied by context. ex. Let $S = \\{1, 2, 3 \\}, A = \\{1, 3\\}$. Then $A^c = \\{2\\}$. Note that $A$ and $A^c$ partition $S$. The cardinality of a set, |A|, indicates the size of the set. For finite sets, it is the number of elements in the set.\nWe notate set membership in the following way: letting $A = \\{8, 1, 2\\}$,\n‚Äú$2$ is in $A$‚Äù is notated $2 \\in A$. ‚Äú$0$ is not in $A$‚Äù is notated $0 \\notin A$. 1.2 Verbal Understanding We want to think about basic set operations in words.\n$x \\in A$ reads as ‚Äú$x$ is in $A$‚Äù. We tend to work with sets by thinking about whether some variable or number is in the (e.g., whether or not $x \\in A$) instead of just looking at the set written out like $A = \\{8, 1, 2\\}$. $A \\cup B$ reads as ‚Äú$A$ or $B$‚Äù. So we can say $x \\in A \\cup B$ intuitively reads as ‚Äú$x$ is in $A$ or $x$ is in $B$‚Äù. Be careful to note that we are using the inclusive or, so $A \\textit{ or } B$ means $A$, $B$, or both. $A \\cap B$ reads as ‚Äú$A$ and $B$‚Äù. So $x \\in A \\cap B$ reads as ‚Äú$x$ is in $A$ and $x$ is in $B$‚Äù. $A^c$ reads as ‚Äúnot $A$‚Äù, so $x \\in A^c$ reads as ‚Äú$x$ is not in $A$‚Äù What if we have multiple operations in the same expression?\n$x \\in (A \\cap B)^c$ reads as ‚Äú$x$ is not in both $A$ and $B$‚Äù. This means that either $x$ is not in $A$ or $x$ is not in $B$, so $x \\in A^c \\cup B^c$. $x \\in (A \\cup B)^c$ read as ‚Äú$x$ is not in $A$ or $B$‚Äù. This means that $x$ is not in $A$ and $x$ is not in $B$, so $x \\in A^c \\cap B^c$. We see that these statements are essentially DeMorgan‚Äôs laws. 1.3 DeMorgan‚Äôs Laws DeMorgan‚Äôs Laws \\begin{align} (A \\cap B)^c \u0026amp;= A^c \\cup B^c \\\\ (A \\cup B)^c \u0026amp;= A^c \\cap B^c \\end{align} By talking through the expressions, you should eventually be able to convince yourself that the laws are true.\nThese videos also walk through the process visually: 2.

As an undergraduate researcher in the Marks Lab at Harvard Medical School, I implemented a mixture model with the EVcouplings pipeline using an expectation-maximization algorithm to simultaneously infer class assignments of each sequence in an MSA and the Potts model parameters of each class.
